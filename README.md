## About

I often need to trace a blame through many revisions to figure out when a specific change was introduced. This is painful using git or GitHub, especially if the file was renamed at some point. `recursive-blame` makes tracing through history dead simple.



## Installation

```sh
npm install -g recursive-blame
```



## Usage

```sh
recursive-blame <pattern> <path>
```

See [usage.txt](/usage.txt) for full usage documenation.
